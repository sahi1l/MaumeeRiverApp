    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    <p> Maumee River Solitaire is based on the card game <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring-Bone_(card_game)">Herringbone</A>. It is named after the Maumee River in Ohio.  Features of this version include a compact layout that changes the card size to maximize playability on any screen, an autoplay feature, and highlighting of root and duplicate cards in the river.</p>
    <p>This code uses <A HREF="https://capacitorjs.com">CapacitorJS</A> to wrap a previously written <A HREF="https://github.com/sahi1l/MaumeeRiverSolitaire">web app I wrote</A> for mobile use.  The game itself is written in Javascript and CSS.

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <UL>
      <LI>Played with two standard 52-card decks.</li>
      <LI><B>Goal:</B> Build up the eight wrap-around <dfn>foundations</dfn> by suit.  You can play a card to the foundation by clicking on it or dragging it to the appropriate spot. The player may choose to build the foundations upward or downward starting from the <dfn>base card</dfn>; a blue arrow appears once the direction has been decided.</LI> 
      <LI>At the start, nineteen cards are placed on the <dfn>river</dfn>. These cannot be moved by the player directly.</li>
      <li>Below the river are five spaces called <dfn>docks</dfn>, which can be played to the foundation. Empty spaces on the dock are automatically filled by the end card on the river.  When the river is empty, docks can act as free spaces.</li>
      <li>Below the docks are eight <dfn>free</dfn> spaces, which can be played to the foundation.  Players can move a card from the discard to any empty free space.</li>
      <li>Players can click on the <dfn>deck</dfn> to reveal one card at a time in the discard.  The deck can be played through as many times as desired; the number on top of the deck shows the number of times it has been played through. White numbers to the right of the deck and discard piles show how many cards are in each.</li>
